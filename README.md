## 📢 Telegram Configuration (Optional but Recommended)

If you want real‑time alerts when a takeover is detected, you must configure Telegram manually.

Go to:

configs/telegram-settings.json

Edit the file and replace the placeholder values:
```
{
  "TELEGRAM_TOKEN": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID": "YOUR_CHAT_ID",
  "TELEGRAM_TOPIC_ID": "YOUR_TOPIC_ID",
  "TELEGRAM_ENABLED": true
}
```
### Required Steps:

1. Create a Telegram bot using @BotFather
2. Get your bot token
3. Get your chat ID (private chat or group)
4. (Optional) Get topic ID if using forum groups
5. Set "TELEGRAM_ENABLED": true

If you don’t want Telegram alerts, simply set:

"TELEGRAM_ENABLED": false
